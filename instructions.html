            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Boil water and add salt before placing the pasta into the water.
                    Boil the pasta for around 11 minutes. I prefer 11 minutes as the pasta
                    is a bit more firm. If you prefer a softer pasta, boil for a bit longer.
                </li>
                <li>Drain the pasta after it is done and set aside.</li>
                <li>
                    Dice up the onions and mushrooms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a pan up on medium high heat. Add a bit of oil to the pan and wait until the pan is hot.
                </li>
                <li>Place the onions on the pan and fry until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef to the pan and cook until done. Add seasonings to taste.</li>
                <li>Add the mushrooms in and let it cook on lowheat.</li>
                <li>Add the marinara sauce and the pasta.</li>
            </ol>
